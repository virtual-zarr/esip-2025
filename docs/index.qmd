## Overview

This workshop will include a mostly self-guided exploration of VirtualiZarr 2.0 for either pre-constructed examples or your own data.

You can find out more about VirtualiZarr on [readthedocs](https://virtualizarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and explore the
[source code on GitHub](https://github.com/zarr-developers/VirtualiZarr). If you're familiar with VirtualiZarr 1.0, check out the
[migration guide](https://virtualizarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/migration_guide.html) for information about how this new release differs.

You can download the source code from GitHub:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:virtual-zarr/esip-2025.git
cd esip-2025
```

You can use [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) to create an environment for these examples. After installing pixi, create an environment from the
lock file via:

```bash
pixi install
```
